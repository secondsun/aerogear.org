==== How to install Android SDK with Ansible

WARNING: During the process, you will be asked to accept the Android SDK License Agreement.
 
The Android SDK is required to build Android apps. The installer downloads the Android SDK and makes it available to the building pods by performing the following steps:

* Creating a pod which will be used to download the Android SDK. The pod will use an image that contains the required tools, and claim a Persistent Volume (PV).
* Invoke a script to download the Android SDK. The Android SDK will be retained in the PV.
* Update the Kubernetes plugin configuration to add a new pod template. It will mount and connect the PV in “Read-Only” mode to the pods, and setup the required environment variables to define an Android home directory.

Jenkins dynamically creates containers (pods) on OpenShift using the https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Kubernetes+Plugin[Kubernetes Jenkins plugin^] for each Android build.

===== Configure Android SDK components 

The Android SDK contains many different components. Only a subset of them are installed by default.
